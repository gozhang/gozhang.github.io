Welcome to my homepage! 
I am a fifth-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at University of British Columbia, under the supervision of [Dr. Jiahua Chen](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jhchen/). My current research focuses on semi-parametric models and non-parametric methods (e.g., empirical likelihood).
