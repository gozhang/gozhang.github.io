Hi, welcome! 

I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Glasgow. 
Previously, I was a Department Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto, where I worked with [Dr. Nancy Reid](https://www.utstat.utoronto.ca/reid/) and [Dr. Qiang Sun](https://sites.google.com/view/qsun/). I got my PhD from the Department of Statistics at the University of British Columbia, under the supervision of [Dr. Jiahua Chen](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jhchen/). 

I am generally interested in the theoretical and methodological sides of Statistics. The main theme of my current research is related to data integration and distribution shift. For example, how to make efficient inferences when we have data collected from multiple sources, where the underlying populations are interconnected and their distributions have some common latent structure. I have been working closely on inferences under a semiparametric model called the Density Ratio Model (closely related to biased sampling models, the exponential tilting model, and the proportional likelihood ratio model)  and nonparametric methods (e.g., Empirical Likelihood). I have recently become very interested in transfer learning and causal inference!
