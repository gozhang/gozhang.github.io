Welcome to my homepage! 

I am a Department of Statistical Sciences Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Toronto, where I am working with [Dr. Nancy Reid](https://www.utstat.utoronto.ca/reid/) and [Dr. Qiang Sun](https://sites.google.com/view/qsun/). Previously, I got my PhD from the Department of Statistics at the University of British Columbia, under the supervision of [Dr. Jiahua Chen](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jhchen/). I am generally interested in the theoretical and methodological sides of Statistics. My current research focuses on how to make efficient inferences when we have data collected from multiple sources, where the underlying populations are interconnected and their distributions have some common latent structure. I have been working closely on inferences under a semiparametric model called the Density Ratio Model and nonparametric methods (e.g., Empirical Likelihood). I recently have become very interested in transfer learning and causal inference!
