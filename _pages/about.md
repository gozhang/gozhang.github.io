Welcome to my homepage! 
I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Statistics at the University of British Columbia, under the supervision of [Dr. Jiahua Chen](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jhchen/). I am generally interested in theoretical and methodological sides of Statistics. My current research focuses on how to make efficient inferences when we have data collected from multiple sources, where the underlying population are interconnected and their distributions have some common latent structure. I have been working closely on inferences under a semi-parametric model called Density Ratio Model and non-parametric methods (e.g., Empirical Likelihood). I am also very interested in causal inference!
