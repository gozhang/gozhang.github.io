Abstract: In causal inference, an important problem is to quantify the effects of interventions or treatments. 
Many studies focus on estimating the mean causal effects; however, these estimands may offer limited insight since two distributions can share the same mean yet exhibit significant differences. 
Examining the causal effects from a distributional perspective provides a more thorough understanding. 
In this paper, we employ a semiparametric density ratio model (DRM) to characterize the counterfactual distributions, introducing a framework that assumes a latent structure shared by these distributions. 
Our model offers flexibility by avoiding strict parametric assumptions on the counterfactual distributions. 
Specifically, the DRM incorporates a nonparametric component that can be estimated through the method of empirical likelihood (EL), using the data from all the groups stemming from multiple interventions. 
Consequently, the EL-DRM framework enables inference of the counterfactual distribution functions and their functionals, facilitating direct and transparent causal inference from a distributional perspective. 
Numerical studies on both synthetic and real-world data validate the effectiveness of our approach.
